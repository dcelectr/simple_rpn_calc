Very simple RPN calculator for Arduino

## What's this

I made a keychain type RPN calculator like toy with Arduino.

The aim of the calculator is "anyone can use RPN". So the function is very simple.

- There are only 16 keys, numerals(0-9), operators(+-\*/), decimal point(.), and Enter.
- Integers can only display up to 7 digits.
- Decimals can only display up to 2 digits.
- Display is in fixed-point mode only. If it overflows, an error will occur.

As long as you know RPN, you can use it easily.
